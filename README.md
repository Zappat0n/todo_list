## About the Project

This project is taken from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/javascript/lessons/todo-list).

In this application, Users can:
- Create a to-do list that is saved at the user's local storage
- Arrange todos for different projects
- Create or remove a project and add as many todos as they want to each project
- Edit or remove todos

And We built this application taking care of:
- Organized files and functions based on the MVC concept
- Helper functions to create DOM elements efficiently
- Put a tag to each todo corresponding to its priority with different colors
- Add default data in order to show how to use this app for users
